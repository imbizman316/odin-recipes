        <p><strong><em>The Real Chicago Deep-Dish Pizza Dough</em></strong>
             is a buttery, flaky crust that's achieved by using corn oil
            (not butter) and minimal mixing and kneading times.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2.25 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1.5 teaspoons white sugar</li>
            <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <p>
            <h3>Step 1</h3>
            Dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water in a bowl. 
            Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a 
            creamy foam, 5 to 10 minutes.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3>Step 2</h3>
            Combine yeast mixture, flour, corn oil, and kosher salt
            in a large stand mixer fitted with the dough hook.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3>Step 3</h3>
            Form dough into a ball and transfer to a buttered bowl. 
            Turn to coat with butter, then cover the bowl with a towel
             and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, 
             about 6 hours.
